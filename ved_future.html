What is the future for car tax.

Car tax = VED

Many would argue that the VED (vehicle excise duty) is a blanket approach to car tax.  OK electric cars currently pay no VED, cars which emitt < 100 g/co2 pay x ved,lorries pay x ved, cars older than 2006 pay x ved, classic cars pay x ved, armed forces vehicles pay x ved.

So there are categories which have evolved over time but still based on type of vehicle.  The amount of use of the vehicle is irrelevant.  OK - so we could up the fuel price add on say 30%.  This would rightly force those doing higher mileage or driving ineffecient cars more.  This is a simple approach.  However aside from pissing off hauliers and  uber angry taxi drivers this is not future proof.

Electric cars are on the rise, battery tech is increasing, the cars are great to drive.  People who have gone electric are generally pretty enthusiastic about their wheels.  A petrol tax won't cover this.  Also in the future when driver-less cars become a reality and that reality is happening quicker than people think then individual car ownership will drop.  How much of your car's life is spent doing nothing parked up.  These space gobbling assets will become pooled.  A car, perhaps owned by Barclays, will come along and pick you up and drop you off at the demand of an app.  You may even share that car with others who are going in a similar direction.

So we currently all have smartphones.  With these phones we can use GPS to track our journeys.  In the future each car will have a GPS built in.  So why not tax cars on a per mile scale.  But we can go further than this - which is essentially equivalent to a current increase in fuel duty.  We can create road segements, like the cycling app Strava, and price according to which road the car is travelling on.  For example travelling through central London at rush hour could be more expensive than off peak times.  Rural roads could be charged less, motorways more.  If the car is driving at 160km/h then this could attract a greater charge than a car driving at 130km/h.

 In 2014, all motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain was 311 billion vehicle miles - See more at: http://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/mobility#a24
 The total road length in Great Britain in 2014 was estimated to be 245.8 thousand miles - See more at: http://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/mobility#a27

At the end of September 2015 there were 36.5 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads in Great Britain, of which 30.2 million were cars - See more at: http://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/mobility#a1


96% of the time the car is idle.  Which means the average car is used for 58 minutes per day.
32 million cars so if car use was evenly distributed over 24 hours then at any one time 1.28 million cars are in use.
Estimates are that 15 million people drive themselves to work each day (1.4 million catch a lift), so assume that .  Assuming that Let's say that at rush hour there are 12  million cars on the road.  So if the max number of cars on the road at any point in the year is 12 million.

This means that there is a stock of 20 million cars which could be made redundant with better use of car resources.

How much area do these cars take up: the most common car in the UK is the ford focus.

At 4.358 metres long parked nose to tail these 20 million surplus cars would create a traffic jam a little over 87,000 km.(54,000 miles).  Motorways make up 1% of the total road length of 245.8 thousand miles. 2.458 thousand miles of motorway.  If the average number of lanes for all the motorways is a generous 6 (3 in both directions) then that means that in the UK we have 14.724 thousand miles of motorway lanes.  That means we would need 3.6 times more motorway just to accomadate these cars parked nose to tail in each lane in each direction of those motorways!

Lets look at it another way, how big a parking lot would these surplus cars need.  Given a buffer zone of 10cm around each car then a focus measures (1.823+.2) wide and (4.556+.2) long. So the area required to park a focus in the lot would be (1.823 + .2) * (4.556 + .2) = 9.62 sqm.

Total area for redundant cars is 20,000,000 * 9.62 = 192,427,760 sqm


= (192427760 / 4046.86) = 47549.89 acres.

= 192.43 sq km or 74.3 sq miles which would mean a parking lot about 6 times the size of central london.










Therefore the storage requirements of the 20 million surplus cars would be

In urban areas 50 percent of cars are parked on the street.

Say during rush hour 10 million cars are in use. Most commuting cars are single occupancy.



So how do we model this data.
A gpx file made from my phone contains.




5458/136 = 40 per min




14663/270(moving), 281(total) = 54 per minute
