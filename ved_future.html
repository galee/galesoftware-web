          <p>In April 2017 we are going to see Changes to the current VED rates.  Modern cars with their low emmissions are leaving a hole in the exchequers budget. The chances are you will be worse off from 2017 - see below for a few car comparisons of what you pay now for VED and what you will pay in  for the same car next year.<p>

            <p>What we're really interested in here is how we may approach vehicle taxation not in a couple of years but 10 years plus.

             Many would argue that the VED (vehicle excise duty) is an unjust approach to vehicle taxation.  Whereby those who drive 1000 miles per year pay the same amount of fixed priced duty as someone who drives 50000 mlies per year. Even though, since 2001, VED costings have been largely based on the CO2 emissions of the vehicle, low mileage drivers are still relatively worse off.  Through taxation and European legislation the cars we are driving are becoming cleaner and cleaner, leading to the current VED duty leaving a hole in the chancellors bank account.
            <p>To get around this loss of revenue from April 2017 there is a change to VED.  There will be a change to the one off charge when the vehicle is bought.  This one off purchase tax charge based on list price and CO2 emissions. Further years taxation will be £140 for all vehicles unless the list price of the vehicle is over 40,000 in which case it will be £450 for 5 years before dropping to £140 per year thereafter. Vehicles registered pre April 2017 will remain VED'wise as they are now.<p>

            Below are a few cars and what you pay now and what you'll pay in 2017 for the same car.

            One solution touted is to cancel the VED and all associated costs of the taxation and instead up the fuel duty. In fact such a scheme has been proposed, but no implemented, before in 2007 - the Lorry Road-User Charge. Currently fuel prices are 102 pence per litre (Jan 2016) of which duty makes up 58 pence.
            The total income to the exchequer of VED £6 billion and from fuel duty is 27 billion (2014).  Therefore by upping the fuel duty by 20%, taking the fuel duty from 58p per litre to 68.6p per litre we could cover the 6 billion shortfall if VED was scrapped.  This would mean a litre would currently cost nearly 115 pence per litre (inc. application of VAT). With the recent fall in fuel price this figure of 115p per litre seems OK, we were paying more than this in 2010. Sot he logical solution is to scrap VED and cover the offset by upping the fuel duty right?</p>

            <p>Wrong, apart from aggravating high mileage lorry drivers and already Uber angry cabbies such an approach is not future proof.  Electric vehicles are here and unlike the Sinclair C5 this time they are here to stay. The future is most likely electric with many manufacturers backing this type of vehicle over hydrogen due to the infrastructure already in place. Currently hydrogen fuel cell technology does, theoretically, have an advantage in the propulsion of large vehicles.  But battery tech is undergoing major investment (The Tesla gigafactory in Nevada is alone receiving 5 billion dollars of investement). Unlike Hydrogen cars, which could have duty added to Hydrogen, Adding duty to household electricity is a difficult political proposition.</p>

              <p> Lets look to the longer term future for Vehicle taxation - say 20+ years.  Even in the last week the main news has had a couple of stories regarding autonomous vehicles. There will be testing in 2016 for a train of autononmous lorries on the motorways in the North of England (with the lead lorry having a driver). There was also an article on Volvo selecting 100 drivers in Sweden to test autonomous cars in a more general setting (on roads without bikes or pedestrians).  I had a ride in a Tesla the other day.  Not only did it do 250 miles per charge and 0-60 in 3.1 seconds it also came with the autopilot feature.  This worked well for the straight road (Swansea sea front) we were on even though it was dark and there were several sets of traffic lights. This technology is moving apace with government and manufacturer buy-in. One day, probably sooner than we think,we'll all be transported from A to B in an efficient manner in our electric/hyrdrogen cars without even driving. Even the news last night said that children born now may perceive with amusement the quaint antics of us actually driving</p>
              <p>In the future why own a car when an app can summon a driverless car, a driverless Uber if you like, to come and pick you up and transport you to your destination. Maybe you could share this transport with others going the same way. As most people's second most expensive asset a car spends an awful lot of its time doing nothing. 96% of the time actually.</p>

              <p>For 58 minutes each day the car is in use. There are 32 million cars in the UK so if car use was evenly distributed over 24 hours then at any one time 1.28 million cars would be in use.  The RAC estimates are that 15 million people drive themselves to work each day (1.4 million catch a lift), so lets assume that at rush hour there are 12 million cars using the roads around the country. So if this car pooling really took off we'd need 12 million cars on standby.  Actually we'd probably need fewer but let's say 12 million to be on the safe side.  After all with 12 million cars then 60 million (5 per car) of us could be heading to Cornwall for the Easter bank holiday</p>
              <p>This means that there are 20 million cars in excess of what we need. Profligate. Let's look at it another way - if we parked these 20 million cars nose to tail then  we would need nearly 15000 miles of 3 lane motorway in each direction to park these cars.  (Forget the idea of heading to Cornwall for the bank holiday then). In fact we'd need to build 3.6 times more motorway just to have every part of this motorway network parked nose to tail with the amount of surplus car ownership. Put it another way  - Barrat could build over 640,000 executive 4 bedroom hutches homes on the space currently used by surplus cars.</p>


              <p>If every car has a GPS tracker then we can add a couple of variables into the road taxation equation: distance and location.  It would give the government micro levels of control on how we use our cars and travel and where we go. Somewhat a dystopian Orwellian future.
                <ul>
                  <li>Rural roads charged less than urban roads</li>
                  <li>Motorways charged more</li>
                  <li>Peak times charged more</li>
                  <li>Segmentmentation of the road network so the M42 could be charged more than the M5</li>
                  <li>Higher speeds could attract greater taxation</li>
                  <li>Increase price for car usage in cities</li>
                  <li>Increase prices for journies less than a mile</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>Lets keep it simple, its starting to sound like the First Great Western ticket pricing policy. Lets come up with a solution of how to charge for use of the roads which would add up to the current VED and the fuel duty combined</p>

              <p>Keeping it really really simple if all roads were charged the same then:
                total ved is 6 billion from VED + 26 billion from fuel duty.
                311 billion vehicle miles are travlled each year - charge would be and if fuel duty was scrapped the charge would be almost 10 pence to cover both duties. A return car journey from Cardiff to London would cost 30 quid.  If you did 10000 miles per year then you'd end up paying £1000 in tax to replace your VED and fuel duty with a road pricing scheme.

                Say your car did 40 miles per gallon and fuel costs (1.02 * 4.546) per gallon then your current costs for 10,0000 miles is 250 * 4.64 = 1160 = 660 (58/102).  If you pay 150 VED then total tax at the moment is 810. You'd be 190 worse off.

                Say your car does 60 miles per gallon and you do 3000 miles per year.

                96% of the time the car is idle.  Which means the average car is used for 58 minutes per day.
                32 million cars so if car use was evenly distributed over 24 hours then at any one time 1.28 million cars are in use.
                Estimates are that 15 million people drive themselves to work each day (1.4 million catch a lift), so assume that .  Assuming that Let's say that at rush hour there are 12  million cars on the road.  So if the max number of cars on the road at any point in the year is 12 million.

                This means that there is a stock of 20 million cars which could be made redundant with better use of car resources.

                How much area do these cars take up: the most common car in the UK is the ford focus.

                At 4.358 metres long parked nose to tail these 20 million surplus cars would create a traffic jam a little over 87,000 km.(54,000 miles).  Motorways make up 1% of the total road length of 245.8 thousand miles. 2.458 thousand miles of motorway.  If the average number of lanes for all the motorways is a generous 6 (3 in both directions) then that means that in the UK we have 14.724 thousand miles of motorway lanes.  That means we would need 3.6 times more motorway just to accomadate these cars parked nose to tail in each lane in each direction of those motorways!

                Lets look at it another way, how big a parking lot would these surplus cars need.  Given a buffer zone of 10cm around each car then a focus measures (1.823+.2) wide and (4.556+.2) long. So the area required to park a focus in the lot would be (1.823 + .2) * (4.556 + .2) = 9.62 sqm.

                Total area for redundant cars is 20,000,000 * 9.62 = 192,427,760 sqm


                = (192427760 / 4046.86) = 47549.89 acres.

                = 192.43 sq km or 74.3 sq miles which would mean a parking lot about 6 times the size of central london.










                Therefore the storage requirements of the 20 million surplus cars would be

                In urban areas 50 percent of cars are parked on the street.
                The total road length in Great Britain in 2014 was estimated to be 245.8 thousand miles - See more at: http://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/mobility#a27



                Say during rush hour 10 million cars are in use. Most commuting cars are single occupancy.



                So how do we model this data.
                A gpx file made from my phone contains.




                5458/136 = 40 per min




                14663/270(moving), 281(total) = 54 per minute
