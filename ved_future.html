What is the future for car tax.

Car tax = VED

Many would argue that the VED (vehicle excise duty) is a blanket approach to car tax.  OK electric cars currently pay no VED, cars which emitt < 100 g/co2 pay x ved,lorries pay x ved, cars older than 2006 pay x ved, classic cars pay x ved, armed forces vehicles pay x ved.

So there are categories which have evolved over time but still based on type of vehicle.  The amount of use of the vehicle is irrelevant.  OK - so we could up the fuel price add on say 30%.  This would rightly force those doing higher mileage or driving ineffecient cars more.  This is a simple approach.  However aside from pissing off hauliers and  uber angry taxi drivers this is not future proof.

Electric cars are on the rise, battery tech is increasing, the cars are great to drive.  People who have gone electric are generally pretty enthusiastic about their wheels.  A petrol tax won't cover this.  Also in the future when driver-less cars become a reality and that reality is happening quicker than people think then individual car ownership will drop.  How much of your car's life is spent doing nothing parked up.  These space gobbling assets will become pooled.  A car, perhaps owned by Barclays, will come along and pick you up and drop you off at the demand of an app.  You may even share that car with others who are going in a similar direction.

So we currently all have smartphones.  With these phones we can use GPS to track our journeys.  In the future each car will have a GPS built in.  So why not tax cars on a per mile scale.  But we can go further than this - which is essentially equivalent to a current increase in fuel duty.  We can create road segements, like the cycling app Strava, and price according to which road the car is travelling on.  For example travelling through central London at rush hour could be more expensive than off peak times.  Rural roads could be charged less, motorways more.  If the car is driving at 160km/h then this could attract a greater charge than a car driving at 130km/h.

At the end of September 2015 there were 36.5 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads in Great Britain, of which 30.2 million were cars - See more at: http://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/mobility#a1




So how do we model this data.

5458/136 = 40 per min




14663/270(moving), 281(total) = 54 per minute
