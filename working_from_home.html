Working from home
make the perk work

This should be treated just as you would going to the office.  The expectation is for a full days work, this is not an 'inset' day.

Room should be away from major distractions (think children).  Multi screened approach with one permanently set up on webcam.  Software to allow screen sharing, use of instant message (google hangouts / skype).  Always available to chat.  Messages left when going from the office stating - back in 5, or Out for lunch back at 2.

Team members living close can also share houses or rent office space, go to a tech hub to increase collaboration and maintain motivation.

Would recommend that 2 days per week were still spent in an office type atmosphere.
