Multi Skilled developers

Google is your friend.  Gone are they days when a developer knew only one language.  With the advent of knowledge sharing via websites such as stack overflow there is no reason now why a programmer who once specialised in C and java cannot now also be creative with other technologies like MongoDB, python, Swift and so forth.  Gone are the days of wading through ring binders of product documentation. The skills are now as much as finding information and applying it to your use cases as they are remembering the intricacies of memory management.  There is a time penalty to this cross skilling however a proactive, bright developer can utilise the brains plasticity to rapidly upskill in many areas.

This enables the use of smaller teams.  Google are famous for using this approach, one of the interview questions is "What is the most productive size team".  Obviously this depends on the project however cross functional teams of 5 is a lean way of getting things done.

Cloud
Goodbye fixed overheads.
So small teams are good.  And developing and deploying applications in the cloud helps keep the team small.  This is because we have less need for the infrastructure guys, the networks guys, the unix admins.  Let the cloud provider give you this.  It means the team can focus on writing software not get bogged down in the fixed overheads of hardware.

Agile.
Common sense.
Small multi skilled teams are also agile.  Most jobs now require at least some form of Agile knowledge.  Iterative development with multi stage targets is simply common sense.  The motivation can be maintained using Agile techniques (see blog post System1 and System2 brain processes).

Open source
Cheerio vendor tie in.
How many times has a slick salesman from one the of the big boys sold little more than poorly executed beta software riddled with bugs to an unsuspecting CTO. This software may or may not even match the original use case.  Many implementations can be wholly designed and developed using open source software as the add ons.  Whether it be the logging package or webserver running in the cloud VM.  For most open source software there is a heap of documentation out there.  At the very worst you can always inspect the code yourself.  Obviously popular and highly rated open source software is good.

Collaboration
Good collaboration within teams and across teams is essential.  Such tools as Google docs, a slick company specific Gmail interface and an company intranet based on google sites (including hangouts etc.) can acheive this.  Agile methodologies encourage face to face working.  Whilst true we also think that working from home as well as development in say a tech hub also has its place as well as being on the client site for other days.  See the working from home blog for more info.
